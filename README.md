Wasn't satisfied with the way my vacuum cleaner could move around on its base, so created a holder for the bottom.

Vacuum is a [Dyson Cyclone V10 total clean+](https://amzn.to/2sMd589) (Amazon).  
Purchased mine Costco, but it would seem that any V10 model should work (please let me know  
if you try it with this or other models: hi@jeremyscook.com

Filament used: [Ziro Marble color](https://amzn.to/2Pf6JqD) (Amazon)

Update: now with a tool holder that's printed separately, and attaches with zip ties:
